This is where I'll put my notes for creation

* What does this even do
This is a system for defining architecture as code. It allows us to define and manage
archeticture in a predicatable reproducable way.
* Why am I doing this?
I have the belief that architecture should be a distributed effort. Instead of one single person managing
all the architecture of a system (read: single source of failure) you can have many people managing their
specific pieces.
