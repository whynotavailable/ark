# What does this even do

This is a system for defining architecture as code. It allows us to define and manage
archeticture in a predicatable reproducable way.

# Why am I doing this?

I have the belief that architecture should be a distributed effort. Instead of one single person managing
all the architecture of a system (read: single source of failure) you can have many people managing their
specific pieces. A problem with traditional systems is people don't update them. With code, you can track
and make sure that people update them. This promoted keeping stuff up to date. It will also help because
a feature I am planning is a comparison tool. So that you can compare two output files which will tell
you what you need to do, to get from a to b.mm

# TODO Distributed export

Point the thing at several sources, and export them all together into Neo4j (do this over the weekend to start using at work monday.
