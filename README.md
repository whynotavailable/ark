# Ark

Ark is a system for managing architecture as code. Specifically as javascript code.
It allows you to piecemeal architecture, and even federate it. You can
use it to show you what steps you need to do, in order to build your next
project, or even tell you what would happen if a system went down.

It's a project that has a lot of possibility.
